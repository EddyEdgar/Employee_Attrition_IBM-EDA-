Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a method for better understanding your data and assisting in subsequent data preprocessing. It is the critical process of conducting preliminary data investigations to discover patterns, identify anomalies, test hypotheses, and validate assumptions using summary statistics and graphical representations. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a step in the Data Analysis Process that employs a variety of techniques to better understand the dataset under consideration. Exploratory Data Analysis accomplishes two major tasks:
1. It aids in the cleanup of a dataset.
2. It improves your understanding of the variables and their relationships.
EDA assists in gathering insights and making better sense of data, as well as removing irregularities and unnecessary values from data, aids in preparing dataset for analysis, enables a machine learning model to predict dataset more accurately, also aids in the selection of a better machine learning model.
This project extracts, cleans and visualizes the dataset from the IBM employee attrition and the possible factors for employee attrition using sql and pandas.
Employee attrition is the process of workers leaving a company for a variety of reasons, either voluntary or involuntary, without being immediately replaced. Employee attrition refers to the gradual reduction in the number of employees. Employee attrition occurs when your workforce shrinks over time. This means that employees are being hired at a faster rate than they are being replaced. Employee attrition occurs when a worker retires, resigns, or is not replaced.
The project processes include;
Data Extraction
Data Cleaning
